Support my open source efforts
------------------------------
Like my open source projects and learning materials?

I build permissively licensed software solutions for you and your
organization to use on your own terms. I fight hard for permissive
software licensing on open source projects because it is the one
one true way to let the free market flourish with open source.

Your support keeps me doing `open source`_, that includes maintenance of
projects like:

- :ref:`libtmux:index`
- :ref:`tmuxp:index` (`中文 <https://tmuxp.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/>`_)
  - tmux session manager via JSON and YAML file.
- :ref:`vcspull:index` - manage and update multiple git / hg / svn projects
  via JSON or YAML file.
- :ref:`libvcs:index`
- `cookiecutter-pypackage`_ - bootstrap project for python packages.

In addition, my learning resources, available for free online, such as:

- :ref:`reST, docutils, sphinx, readthedocs`
- `The Tao of tmux`_

If you donate to me via any of the methods, please contact me if you'd
like a coupon for any of my Leanpub publications.

If you are directing your donation to a specific project, please let me
know via the notes or by email, tony <at> NOSPAM git-pull.com.

Thank you!
